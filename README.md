# INTRO TO ENCRYPTION

## Day 1: Classical ciphers/ basic encryption. 
1. Caesar cipher: Works by substituting letters using integers. The integer represents the position in the alphabet.
    1.1. Can be solved using simple math like so:

        i. Encryption:
        En(x) = (x + n) mod 26
        - mod: to ensure that if the result is greater than 25, it starts from the beginning.
        - Divides by 26 and returns the remainder (new position)

        ii. Decryption:
        Dn(x) = (x - n + 26) mod 26
        - Adding 26 ensures the result is non-negative

        ***Requires knowing the cipher number/shift.

2. Vigen√®re Cipher: Takes Caesar a step further by using a different number value for each letter based on a keyword.
    2.1. Can be solve using the following formula: 

        i. Encryption:
        C_i = (P_i + K_i) % 26
        - P_i: Position of the plaintext letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
        - K_i: Position of the key letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
        - C_i: Position of the ciphertext letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)

        ii. Decryption:
        P_i = (C_i - K_i + 26) % 26
        - Adding 26 ensures the result is non-negative

        iii. Each letter of the plaintext is encrypted using a different Caesar cipher based on the corresponding letter of the key.

        iv. Example:
       - Plaintext: TOOL (positions: 19, 14, 14, 11)
       - Key: DEAD (repeated to match plaintext length: DEAD, positions: 3, 4, 0, 3)
       - Encryption:
            T (19) + D (3) = W (22)
            O (14) + E (4) = S (18)
            O (14) + A (0) = O (14)
            - L (11) + D (3) = O (14)
            Ciphertext: WSOO

## Day 2: Encryption TLS.
3. Cornerstones og Encryption

        i. Confidenciality: Ability to restrict data/ parts of it to some users.  
        ii. Authenticity: Ability to confirm the the identity of both recipient and data source. 
        iii. Integrity: Confirm that data has not been interfered with during transfer.
        v. Non Repudiation:Data source must not be able to deny that it's the souce. 

3.1. Illustration via GnuPG/ GPG4WWin

3.1.1. GnuPG (GNU privacy guard):

A free open source software for encrypting and signing data. 
    
    The tool does the following
        i. Encryption: both files and messages. 
        ii. Digital signatures: add digital signatures to data for authentication and guarantee safety in transit.
        iii. Key management: generating, storing & managing cryptographic keys (public and private keys). 
        iv. Email security: encrypt and sign emails. 
        v. File encryption: Used to encrypt individual files.  
        vi. Secure communication: chat and file transfer encryption. 
3.2. How it works

    i. Symmetric-key cryptography:for fast encryption of large amounts of data. 
    ii. Assymmetric/ Public-key cryptography: for secure key exchange. 
    iii. Steps: 
        - generating key pairs: each user creates a pair of keys (public and private).  
        - encrypting data: encrypt message using public key (requires matching private key to decrypt). 
        - signing data: uses private and is verified using matching public key.

3.3. How to use GnuPG
        
        i. On windows: install gpg4win. 
        ii. open cmd: 
            - type gpg --list-key (finds the directory automatically)
            - type gpg --gen-key (prompts for a secret phrase) and generates private and public key. 
            - Private key is not include in the output. 
            - gpg --edit-key: lets you edit key attributes. 
            - gpg --delete-key <id>: lets you delete key. 
            - gpg --export -a "user_id" > "path\outputfile.asc": exports file to another folder. 
            - gpg --import "path\file": imports key
            - gpg --edit-key id from import: 
            - fpr: confirms key. 
        iii. Making public-key available
            - use export method like above: make downloadable from site. 
            - display on websit: fpr and paste it on site.
            - key servers (keyp.opengpg.org will be used): gpg --send-keys --keyserver keys.opengpg.org "name" 
            - failde when I used name but the id (3E65401BA3FAF2A1) worked fine. 
        iv. Encrypting a file (either by username or key id)
            - gpg -r "username" -e file
            - output: file.extension.gpg
            - opening before decryption: ‚Äû^‚Äô<√Æ¬æc@√Ωox√©!√ç‚Ç¨d}2J¬≥|?)√Ñ√¨√∂N~_¬è5‚Äò√±√ó¬øZ√æ0√ï≈í√£0√¨≈†)≈∏‚ÄúXz√¢Nm~‚Äπ√≠9¬¨CC√ü√ö¬Ø¬º$=¬Å√ú√∑1√ô -‚Äû!{d‚Ä¶√î√Äo	√ê#"¬£P√ç√ìM,m¬∏‚Äô√ë√ø¬≤r√ï-¬º√Å¬•9√û*√ºy~‚ÄöA√Ç∆í_(≈†|√ã‚ÄôS√ò√Ω¬Æ√â√Ø√ºvJ√ë≈† √¥√ë√ãp97√†√Ç√ÑV¬µ¬¶Y√ªT√µ¬®QQ}√Ç‚Ñ¢=U√Ω‚Ä¢√≠9√ë ¬´¬¢√ÖF_iEO0¬Æ√ñP√≥√ö‚Ä¶√®<w‚Äú¬±^MDJ≈∏d√¶√ü¬•Y ‚Ä°j√•√Ü¬°√î}√ç¬•Xa6¬∑;‚Ä∫U¬Ø√°tHr¬•0√•¬º≈í√ß√º¬∫dp[L!;¬º√ò¬ødN¬ßzr√ã√â[WX8√ø¬æ$≈í.‚Ç¨4c¬∂\√ñ√¨K>‚Äú√é√æuV7√©√û¬Åg√ß¬°¬≤‚Ñ¢√ΩZ √∞%U√ù√©√õ¬Ω√π,√°√±nL:‚Äû‚Äö"√Ç√ò¬£#‚Äôc≈Ω2D≈°√üKI√ø|√≥F#/1v¬Ø√î|':d)Qg;¬çe√¶√∫x2√â√∏√©'√Å8ÀÜ≈íP#p¬§√í√ñlQ√Ä√ï≈í‚Ä¶√£¬°E1√ô‚Äúk‚ÄöK

3.4. TLS 
Simple diagram and explanation.

![alt text](image-2.png)

    Basically, the client shares a key with the server 
    before sending encrypted data. 
    The server uses the key to decrypt the data (revise osi). 

## Day 3: Hashing
4. Hashing algorithms: they differ in the complexity of hashes they produce.  
    i. md5
    ...
    viii. bcrypt 

4.1. Collision: String resulting in similar hashes. Probability is low with existing algorithms. 
4.2. Assignment to check if a password is on the rokyu.text. 

### Steps in solving the exercises. 
    - get rockyou.txt
    - create an app
    - add a database
    - create a user table (user_id, user_name_, user_password as blob (bcrypt hash), )
    - on passwrord creation compare with rockyou.txt. 
    - use singleton pattern to deal with the text file. 
    - add modules to gitignore
#### singleton pattern and relevance to the assignment
    i. Allows to create just one instanc of a class. 
    ii.
