# INTRO TO ENCRYPTION
1. Caesar cipher: Works by substituting letters using integers. The integer represents the position in the alphabet.
    1.1. Can be solved using simple math like so:

        i. Encryption:
        En(x) = (x + n) mod 26
        - mod: to ensure that if the result is greater than 25, it starts from the beginning.
        - Divides by 26 and returns the remainder (new position)

        ii. Decryption:
        Dn(x) = (x - n + 26) mod 26
        - Adding 26 ensures the result is non-negative

        ***Requires knowing the cipher number/shift.

2. Vigen√®re Cipher: Takes Caesar a step further by using a different number value for each letter based on a keyword.
    2.1. Can be solve using the following formula: 

        i. Encryption:
        C_i = (P_i + K_i) % 26
        - P_i: Position of the plaintext letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
        - K_i: Position of the key letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)
        - C_i: Position of the ciphertext letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)

        ii. Decryption:
        P_i = (C_i - K_i + 26) % 26
        - Adding 26 ensures the result is non-negative

        iii. Each letter of the plaintext is encrypted using a different Caesar cipher based on the corresponding letter of the key.

        iv. Example:
       - Plaintext: TOOL (positions: 19, 14, 14, 11)
       - Key: DEAD (repeated to match plaintext length: DEAD, positions: 3, 4, 0, 3)
       - Encryption:
            T (19) + D (3) = W (22)
            O (14) + E (4) = S (18)
            O (14) + A (0) = O (14)
            - L (11) + D (3) = O (14)
            Ciphertext: WSOO
